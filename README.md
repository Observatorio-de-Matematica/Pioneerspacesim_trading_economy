# Hello-pioneer. An article about game's trading system.
(With pioneer i mean my lovely space simulation game https://pioneerspacesim.net/.)

Trying to learn hello world GitHub flow.
I am trying to learn some GitHub stuff here....
I am too old for this but I like pioneer game. So, I start with beginner's stuff.

------I didn't finished my try about github, but i finished an article:)-------

I submit my thoughts about the trading system of my lovely game. I am not able to create dedicated web page, so i upload my pdf article [pionner-economy.pdf](https://github.com/jimishol/Pioneerspacesim_trading_economy/files/7026706/pionner-economy.pdf)
 here, in a place that started as github tutorial. I thanks github, for giving me this opportunity.

In my thoughts, commodity prices, stock, cargo ship spaces, value of ships, all are connected. The article is based mainly on the theoretical assumption of mathematical optimization by agents in equilibrium. As a result, the need for additional code almost does not exist. The assumption is different than that https://pioneerwiki.com/wiki/Commodity_Prices, at a first glance, finds interesting. The agent based computational economy in previous link, for me, it is  indeed very interesting, but has the disadvantage that requires a game into game or an economy simulation into galaxy simulation, in other words too much code and team work. My article propose an alternative till we get an economy simulation in pioneer.

Use your jundgment and do not use results of calculation as they appear in article. I just acquired 'sinonatrix' and i can not have the 30t free cargo i assumed in article. So, as it is, it can not be used as the smallest effectively trading merchant ship. One has to define such a ship in order to solve for 'a', 'constant' and equilibrium values.

The creation of article was possible through latex https://www.latex-project.org/ and its frond end texstudio https://www.texstudio.org/. Both proved valuable to me for many years.

I can not guaranty for how long my github account will either exist or be maintained. Feel free to copy paste anything you like somewhere else. Although, I would be happy to know if someone found my article interesting.

Pleasy avoid harsh comments, if you disagree with my writtings. I hope for me to have a few more healthy years, i have no time to improve myself, so let me rest in peace.

Thank you.

In doc folder there are all the files i used for the creation of my pdf article. I took no care to comment them. I hope anyone who will try to use them will eventually recognize the connection with my article. The files that are mentioned by the article are accurate. Other files were temporary auxiliary files, heavily edited, that helped me during the creation of the article. Anyway, i upload all for the sake of completeness.
