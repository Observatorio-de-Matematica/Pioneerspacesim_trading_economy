# Hello-pioneer. An article about game's trading system.
(With pioneer i mean my lovely space simulation game https://pioneerspacesim.net/.)

Trying to learn hello world GitHub flow.
Excuse my ignorance. I am trying to learn some GitHub stuff here.
I am too old for this but I like pioneer game. So, I start with beginner's stuff.
Just to see what happens editing second time in branch readme-edits before PR merge.
And this is edit of main before PR.
------I didn't finished my try about github, but i finished an article:)-------

I submit my thoughts about the trading system of my lovely game. I am not able to create dedicated web page, so i upload my pdf article [pionner-economy.pdf](https://github.com/jimishol/hello-pioneer/files/7025660/pionner-economy.pdf) here, in a place that started as github tutorial. I thanks github, for giving me this opportunity.

In my thoughts, commodity prices, stock, cargo ship spaces, value of ship, all are connected.

The creation of article was possible through latex https://www.latex-project.org/ and its frond end texstudio https://www.texstudio.org/. Both proved valuable to me for many years.

I can not guaranty for how long by github account will either exist or be maintained. Feel free to copy paste anything you like somewhere else. Although, I would be happy to know if someone foud my article interesting.

Pleasy avoid harsh comments, if you disagree with my writtings. I hope to have a few more healthy years, i have no time to improve myself, so let me rest in peace.

Thank you.
