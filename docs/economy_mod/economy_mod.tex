	Easily from equation 14, equation 13 is transformed to
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:profitRatio_ij}
		\dfrac{Profit_{j}}{Profit_{i}}=\Big(\dfrac{P_{i}}{P_{j}}\Big)^{a-1}=\Big(\dfrac{V^{**}_{ship_{j}}}{V^{**}_{ship_{i}}}\Big)^{\dfrac{a-1}{a}}
	\end{equation}
\paragraph{We pretend to have one merchant ship with its upgrades.} In each one we equip autopilot, ecm, default hyperdrive, all missiles, radar, shield generator and some hydrogen for hyper jumps. We will take into consideration 16 ships, so, we assume, our ship  to have 15 upgrades.
Because pioneer lucks the upgrade mechanism, we will eventual call 
\begin{itemize}
\item Merchant\_15 free 3069t	dsminer -831
\item Merchant\_14 	lodos -454
\item Merchant\_13 	vatakara -830
\item Merchant\_12	nerodia -655
\item Merchant\_11	malabar -833
\item Merchant\_10	storeria -409
\item Merchant\_9	venturestar -274
\item Merchant\_8	molaramsayi -156
\item Merchant\_7	ac33 -273
\item Merchant\_6 	bluenose -66
\item Merchant\_5	deneb -71
\item Merchant\_4	skipjack -90
\item Merchant\_3	natrix -24
\item Merchant\_2	molamola -24
\item Merchant\_1	sinonatrix -21
\item Merchant\_0 free 13t	lunarshuttle -13
\end{itemize}
where minus numbers is the weight of referenced equipment plus a minimum jump fuel.
We want each ship's upgrade to give, eye detectable, more profit from previous upgrade. I consider 25\% such an improvement. So, \[1.25^{15}=28.42=\frac{Profit_{dsminer}}{Profit_{lunarshuttle}}=\Big(\dfrac{V^{**}_{ship_{dsiner}}}{V^{**}_{ship_{lunashuttle}}}\Big)^{\dfrac{a-1}{a}}=\Big(\dfrac{3069}{13}\Big)^{\dfrac{a-1}{a}}\Rightarrow\]\[a=2.581079957283195\]
Since we want 'lunarshuttle' and 'dsminer' ship's cargo fixed, $a$ is fixed because it is determined by them.
Only first and last free cargo are taken graded as 13t and 3069, free cargo of other ships will be estimated. From one to next we have $V^{**}_{i+1}=1.25^{\tfrac{a}{a-1}}*V^{**}_{i}=1.43947*V^{**}_{i}$. We add the weight of equipment and we have the new free cargo space of ships
\begin{itemize}
	\item dsminer	3900
\item 	lodos	2586
	
\item 	vatakara	2311
\item 	nerodia	1684

We order 22 legal commodities such that each next commodity to give more profit from previous one as $Profit_{i+1}=b*Profit_{i}$. We want of course the first and last commodities to be traded by the last and first ships so as to have the same ratio of profits.  We find $b=1.17279319635886$\footnote{Filled in commodities.ods, sheet my\_economy, cell D2}.
\subparagraph{$constant$ equals to stock produced on a commodity priced $1\,credit$.} Stock is calculated at SpaceStation.lua as integer random function. I don't want to exceed integer limits, so i set $constant=10^9$. Given that, we want 'precious metals' stock at $V^{**}_{precious\_metals}=13t$, so its price calculated to $1426 credits/t$. All above determine the prices of all commodities.
\paragraph{Solve equilibrium} for 'lunarshuttle' at a price of 35002 credits. I used 'economy\_mod\_equilibrium.wxmx' and wxmaxima for that. The lunarshuttle's profit $Profit_{lunarshuttle}=2832.939$ was calculated my the help of equation 19, with $a$ and $constant$ that just found.
\subparagraph*{Using found prices for ships,} the duration of economy game is $787su$, while, in current state, it last $97su$. We constructed our economy such $Profit_{ship_{i}}=Profit_{ship_{0}}*1.25^{i}$. If we use a discount $\lambda$ like the one at end of page 48 
\[\underset{i > current}{Ship_{i}value}=\lambda*T*(1-\dfrac{q_{current}}{q_{i}})+\dfrac{B_{current}}{2}\]then the duration is given by \[duration=\dfrac{T}{q_{0}}*\big(\lambda-\dfrac{\lambda}{1.25^{14}}+\dfrac{1}{1.25^{14}}\big)\]   We solve for $\lambda$ and  find all discounted ship prices.

We set cargo field in json ship file and, by same amount used for its alteration, we alter capacity field too\footnote{\nopagebreak'Amphiesma' maybe should belong in the chain of merchant ships but, when i started the calculations, i estimated its cargo as too low even for precious metals and excluded it. In order for prices to somehow lead to 'lunarshuttle', that is the start of merchant ship and its upgrades chain, i altered the price for 'Amphiesma' to be exactly between "Xylophis" and 'lunarshuttle'.  }.

It seems that pioneer take care about their fluctuation.
\paragraph{A prerequisite mechanism is added} just before and in 'addRandomShipAdvert' function, in SpaceStaion.lua. By this, one can acquire a merchant ship only if he is its predecessor\footnote{An addition of a prerequisite tag in json ship files would be much better and cleaner solution but seemed to me that C code should be needed to export it to lua. So, i used a 'dirty' sequence of \textsf{'if'} statements in lua.}. If the predecessor of a ship is empty string then it can be acquired anyway. With the addition of such a tag keeping it empty will not affect pioneer at all. But ship designers can create a series of ships consisting of a model and its upgrades, set, only on upgrades, their prerequisite tag, solve for this series equilibrium and offer a fully calibrated on economy model.
\subparagraph{UpdateEquipmentStock} function is altered a little so as major exports from a system to provide 36\% more profit for 6 months, from the player's very first visit, than that it will offer later. This is done because stations hope to lure new customers away from their routine trading. I hope to lure player to discover new systems by increased profit.
\paragraph{Taxi and assasination mission} have reduced their typical rewards according to 'lunarshuttle' average profit, when it trades in its full extend. I wanted initial trading not to be overlapped by mission profits. For taxi mission their average profit set to 2/3 of 'lunarshuttle' profit and for assassination missions to 3/4 of the same profit.
